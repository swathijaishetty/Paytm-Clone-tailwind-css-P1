### By completing this project, I learnt many things about TAILWIND CSS. Few include:

- Learnt the syntax of many traditional CSS properties like margin, padding, background flex properties etc in Tailwind CSS.
- Making a website responsive (according to different screen-sizes).
- Styling a website became handy, by using Tailwind CSS.



 ### It took me around 10 hours to complete this project !
